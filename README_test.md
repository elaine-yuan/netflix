Too Fraught to Handle? An Analysis of Netflix TV Shows

In a weeklong independent project, I analyzed several Netflix Top 10 datasets. I wanted to see if my analysis of Netflix’s top TV shows can lead to findings that can improve Netflix’s content and perhaps by extension, its current situation. I expected to see the popularity of reality TV shows, such as Too Hot to Handle, but I actually found the popularity of dramas and Korean content, which obviously includes Squid Game. Even more surprising to me was the popularity of Cocomelon, a musical preschool series, and Colombian content, such as The Queen of Flow.

After data cleaning in Excel and data analysis in Tableau, I presented my three content suggestions in a PowerPoint presentation:
1.	Continue to release dramas.
2.	Expand foreign programming.
3.	Consider children's content.
